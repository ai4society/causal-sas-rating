On the UP face, the white cross will have the white centerpiece with the white edge pieces forming the cross. It is also important that color stickers of the white edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpieces.  We can see an example of the white cross below. nan Today, I'll teach you the moves to solve the white cross by focusing on putting the white-green edge piece in its correct place.
