5,1,2,"Hey girl, Yes",1.0
5,0,2,Let's talk about the white cross!,1.0
5,0,2," First, what does the white cross even look like? On the UP face, the white cross will have the white centerpiece with the white edge pieces forming the cross. It is also important that color stickers of the white edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpieces.",0.99
5,0,2, We can see an example of the white cross below.,0.84
5,0,2,,0.95
5,0,2,"Today, I'll teach you the moves to solve the white cross by focusing on putting the white-green edge piece in its correct place. By learning these moves for the white-green edge piece, you can apply them to the other white edge pieces and solve the white cross.",1.0
5,1,2,"Hey girl, Continue",1.0
5,0,2,We've broken the moves you need to know into different levels which will gradually increase in complexity.,0.98
5,0,2," In each level, I'll guide you through finding the white-green edge piece and how you can move it to put it in place.",1.0
