14,0,2,"Hello, welcome to ALLURE! I'm Ally and I want to teach everyone how to solve a Rubik's Cube."
14,0,2,Today we'll learn the different moves you need to know to solve the white cross.
14,0,2, Would you like to hear more about the white cross and how we will learn the moves?
14,1,2,Yes
14,0,2,Let's talk about the white cross!
14,0,2," First, what does the white cross even look like? On the UP face, the white cross will have the white centerpiece with the white edge pieces forming the cross. It is also important that color stickers of the white edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpieces."
14,0,2, We can see an example of the white cross below.
14,0,2,
14,0,2,"Today, I'll teach you the moves to solve the white cross by focusing on putting the white-green edge piece in its correct place. By learning these moves for the white-green edge piece, you can apply them to the other white edge pieces and solve the white cross."
14,1,2,Continue
14,0,2,We've broken the moves you need to know into different scenarios which will gradually increase in complexity.
14,0,2," In each scenario, I'll guide you through finding the white-green edge piece and how you can move it to put it in place."
14,0,2," To see the move performed on the virtual cube, just type in 'Solve'."

18,0,1, Would you like to hear more about the white cross and how we will learn the moves?
18,1,1,Yes
18,0,1,Let's talk about the white cross!
18,0,1," First, what does the white cross even look like? On the UP face, the white cross will have the white centerpiece with the white edge pieces forming the cross. It is also important that color stickers of the white edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpieces."
18,0,1, We can see an example of the white cross below.
18,0,1,
18,0,1,"Today, I'll teach you the moves to solve the white cross by focusing on putting the white-green edge piece in its correct place. By learning these moves for the white-green edge piece, you can apply them to the other white edge pieces and solve the white cross."
18,1,1,Continue
18,0,1,We've broken the moves you need to know into different scenarios which will gradually increase in complexity.
18,0,1," In each scenario, I'll guide you through finding the white-green edge piece and how you can move it to put it in place."
18,0,1," To see the move performed on the virtual cube, just type in 'Solve'."
18,0,1,Awesome! Go ahead and pick a scenario to start learning:
18,1,1,Scenario 1
18,0,1,Scenario: 1
18,0,1,"In scenario 1, we can see that all the color stickers of the white-color edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpiece, but to acheive the White Cross the white stickers need to pair with the white center piece too"
18,0,1,Turn the front face until the white-green edge piece completes the White Cross.
