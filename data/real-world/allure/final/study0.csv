5,0,1,"Today, I'll teach you the moves to solve the white cross by focusing on putting the white-green edge piece in its correct place. By learning these moves for the white-green edge piece, you can apply them to the other white edge pieces and solve the white cross."
5,1,1,Continue
5,0,1,We've broken the moves you need to know into different levels which will gradually increase in complexity.
